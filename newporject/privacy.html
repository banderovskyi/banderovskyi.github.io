                        privacy.&nbsp; We know that users of apps are becoming increasingly concerned about what happens
                        to their data.&nbsp; We have invested a significant amount of time and money to ensure that the
                        amount of personal data we collect and store is at a minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

                    </span><strong>Terms of Use</strong><span >) applies to your use of WITHU
                        mobile application software (</span><strong>App</strong><span >) hosted
                        on either the Google Play Store or the Apple app store (each an </span><strong>App
                        Store</strong><span >), once you have downloaded or streamed a copy of
                        the App onto your mobile telephone or handheld device (</span><strong>Device</strong><span
                        >).</span></p>
                    <p><span >This policy also applies where you contact us either directly or through our Website or through links on other websites or social media.</span></p>
                <p><span >This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect
                        from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. This App is not intended for
                        children under the age of 18. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices
                        regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</span></p>
                </p>
                <p><span >When you download the App and agree to our Terms of Use, your mobile
                        device is allocated a unique identification code (</span><strong>Unique Code</strong><span
                        >).&nbsp; All interactions by you (or any other user of the App on your
                        Device) with the App are recorded by reference to the Unique Code.

Depending on how you download the app and the type of device you are using, we may also have access to a unique code associated with your device. Although commercial services are available that would enable us to identify you from this code, we will not use these services to personally identify you.  You will therefore be able to use the app without us being able to identify you.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span >The App has been designed to avoid the need for us to collect
                        personal data about you when you use it.</span></p>
                <p><span >We may require limited personal data about you if you access the app through a download link provided via a partner company or your employer (see below on Contact Data). </span></p>
                <p><span >When you use our app we will identify you through the Unique Code, which
                        identifies your device, but not who you are. We will collect and store all interactions with the
                        App on your device (</span><strong>Usage Data</strong><span >), but
                        only via the Unique Code.&nbsp; Your Device will also store
                        Usage Data in a cache along with your preferences in order to make your user experience as
                        effective as possible.&nbsp; We will also collect and store such Usage Data on our systems to
                        analyse your use, and the functionality of the App. Again this will not be personal data, as it
                        will be linked to your Unique Code and not your personal details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span >
                            
                            Depending on how you download the app and the type of device you are using, we may also have access to a unique code associated with your device, (<strong>IDFA, IDFV , AAID , IP & Android ID</strong>).  Although technically we will not know who you are, we may be able to attach certain additional attributes to your membership as a result of this code and the way in which the advert or promotion was targeted (Social Profile Data).  

                        </span></p>
                        <p><span >
                            
                            For users who gain access to the app through a partner or employer linked website, you may be asked to supply your name and email address (Contact Data) so we can send you the download link.  In such a case we will retain the Contact Data for 3 months, but will delete it as soon as we have sent you the download link.  We will have no way of connecting this Contact Data with your Unique Code.   

                        </span></p>
                <p><span >You may provide additional information such as demographic and
                        personal data (for example, your age, weight, fitness level, location) (</span><strong>Profile
                        Data</strong><span >) when you use the App to make your experience with
                        the App more effective.&nbsp; Again, this is not necessarily personal data, since it will be
                        linked with the Unique Code, but not your identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span >If you contact us via the App, on our Website, or directly by email,
                        you may choose to provide us with contact details such as your name and email address
                        (</span><strong>Communication Data</strong><span >)as well as those of other people, for example if you are purchasing the App as a gift.&nbsp; We cannot
                        connect these details with your Unique Code unless you also provide us with the Unique
                        Code.&nbsp; We will only use the details to communicate with you and with the recipient of the gift, as appropriate, and if necessary, to identify
                        and fix problems associated with your use of the App.</span></p>
                <p><span >We will also collect information to identify what type of Device you
                        are using (</span><strong>Device Data</strong><span >). This will be
                        linked to your Unique Code, and will enable us to optimise the operation of the App.</span></p>
                <p><span >We may also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as
                        statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your
                        personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or
                        indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the
                        percentage of users accessing a specific App feature. However, if we combine or connect
                        Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we
                        treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy
                        policy.</span></p>

                            information you provide when you share information on our social media pages and when you
                            report a problem with the App.&nbsp;</span></li>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span >We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so.

                <p><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong><span
                        >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>Consent</strong><span
                        > means processing your personal data where you have signified your
                        agreement by a statement or clear opt-in to processing for a specific purpose. Consent will only
                        be valid if it is a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of what you
                        want. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</span></p>
                <p><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong><span > means the interest of our
                        business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best
                        service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance
                        any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your
                        personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
                        where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
                        otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we
                        assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific
                        activities by contacting us.</span></p>
                <p><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong><span > means processing your data
                        where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take
                        steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</span></p>
                <p><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong><span > means processing your
                        personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject
                        to.</span></p>
                <p><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span >You have the right to:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Request access</strong><span > to your personal data (commonly
                            known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
                            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Request correction</strong><span > of the personal data that we
                            hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
                            corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to
                            us.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Request erasure</strong><span > of your personal data. This
                            enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
                            continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
                            personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
                            below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
                            erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be
                            able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
                            notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Object to the processing</strong><span > of your personal data
                            where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
                            something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on
                            this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
                            the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
                            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                            process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong><span > of your
                            personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in
                            the following scenarios:</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>(a)</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;if you
                        want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</span></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>(b)</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;where our
                        use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</span></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>(c)</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;where you
                        need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
                        or defend legal claims; or</span></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>(d)</strong><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;you have
                        objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                        grounds to use it.</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li ><strong>Request the transfer</strong><span >
                            of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party
                            you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
                            Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided
                            consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
                            you.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li ><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong><span
                            > where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
                            However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                            withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
                            products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                            your consent.</span></li>
                </ul>
